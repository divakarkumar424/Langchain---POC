In this proof of concept (POC), the aim is to develop three distinct language chain projects:

Conversational Q&A Chatbot: This involves creating a chatbot capable of engaging in natural language conversation and answering user questions. The focus is on providing a conversational experience where users can interact with the chatbot in a question-and-answer format.

Q&A Chatbot: Similar to the conversational Q&A chatbot, this project emphasizes question-and-answer interactions. However, the emphasis may be more on providing concise and accurate answers rather than engaging in extensive conversation.

Text Summarization: This project revolves around generating concise summaries of text content. The goal is to develop algorithms or models that can extract the most important information from a given piece of text and present it in a condensed form.

Overall, these projects aim to showcase different applications of natural language processing and conversational AI techniques, including chatbot development and text summarization.
